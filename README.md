# 🐢 TurtleCarpet – Sierpiński Carpet Generator

This project uses Python's **turtle graphics** module to draw the famous **Sierpiński Carpet**, a fractal pattern made by recursively subdividing a square into smaller squares.

## 🌀 What is a Sierpiński Carpet?

The Sierpiński Carpet is a **plane fractal** first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916. It is formed by subdividing a square into 9 equal parts and removing the central part, then recursively applying the same process to the remaining 8 parts.
